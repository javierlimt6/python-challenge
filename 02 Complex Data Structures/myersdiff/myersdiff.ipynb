    "- genomics analysis (comparing gene/protein sequences)\n",
    "- text analysis (to compare two similar texts)\n",
    "- software updates (diffs between two versions allow the old version to be “patched” with a diff file instead of having to copy the entire new file)\n",
    "- collaboration (version control software generates diffs to move between versions of a file)\n",
